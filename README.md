Connect Four
=========================

My first game written in third week of my education.
It's a really fun project where I used only **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** and **DOM**. I just played with transitions and basic JS.

* Before the game you can chouse the size of your board and your rival

* After somebody wins, you see the color of winner and winning combination
